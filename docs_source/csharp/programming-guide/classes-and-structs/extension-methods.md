# Extension members (C# Programming Guide)

Extension members enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type, recompiling, or otherwise modifying the original type.

Beginning with C# 14, there are two syntaxes you use to define extension methods. C# 14 adds [`extension`](../../language-reference/keywords/extension.md) blocks, where you define multiple extension members for a type or an instance of a type. Before C# 14, you add the [`this`](../../language-reference/keywords/this.md) modifier to the first parameter of a static method to indicate that the method appears as a member of an instance of the parameter type.

Extension blocks support multiple member types: methods, properties, and operators. With extension blocks, you can define both instance extensions and static extensions. Instance extensions extend an instance of the type; static extensions extend the type itself. The form of extension methods declared with the `this` modifier supports instance extension methods.

Extension methods are static methods, but they're called as if they were instance methods on the extended type. For client code written in C#, F# and Visual Basic, there's no apparent difference between calling an extension method and the methods defined in a type. Both forms of extension methods are compiled to the same IL (Intermediate Language). Consumers of extension members don't need to know which syntax was used to define extension methods.

The most common extension members are the LINQ standard query operators that add query functionality to the existing <xref:System.Collections.IEnumerable?displayProperty=nameWithType> and <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1?displayProperty=nameWithType> types. To use the standard query operators, first bring them into scope with a `using System.Linq` directive. Then any type that implements <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1> appears to have instance methods such as <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.GroupBy*>, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.OrderBy*>, <xref:System.Linq.Enumerable.Average*>, and so on. You can see these extra methods in IntelliSense statement completion when you type "dot" after an instance of an <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1> type such as <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List`1> or <xref:System.Array>.

### OrderBy example

The following example shows how to call the standard query operator `OrderBy` method on an array of integers. The expression in parentheses is a lambda expression. Many standard query operators take lambda expressions as parameters. For more information, see [Lambda Expressions](../../language-reference/operators/lambda-expressions.md).

```csharp
int[] numbers = [10, 45, 15, 39, 21, 26];
IOrderedEnumerable<int> result = numbers.OrderBy(g => g);
foreach (int i in result)
{
    Console.Write(i + " ");
}
//Output: 10 15 21 26 39 45
```

Extension methods are defined as static methods but are called by using instance method syntax. Their first parameter specifies which type the method operates on. The parameter follows the [this](../../language-reference/keywords/this.md) modifier. Extension methods are only in scope when you explicitly import the namespace into your source code with a `using` directive.

### Declare extension members

Beginning with C# 14, you can declare *extension blocks*. An extension block is a block in a non-nested, nongeneric, static class that contains extension members for a type or an instance of that type. The following code example defines an extension block for the `string` type. The extension block contains one member: a method that counts the words in the string:

```csharp
namespace CustomExtensionMembers;

public static class MyExtensions
{
    extension(string str)
    {
        public int WordCount() =>
            str.Split([' ', '.', '?'], StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;
    }
}
```

Extension members in an extension block can use open or closed generics. The type parameters can include constraints:

```csharp
public static class MyGenericExtensions
{
    extension<T>(IEnumerable<T> source)
        where T : IEquatable<T>
    {
        public IEnumerable<T> ValuesEqualTo(T threshold)
            => source.Where(x => x.Equals(threshold));
    }
}
```

Before C# 14, you declare an extension method by adding the `this` modifier to the first parameter:

```csharp
namespace CustomExtensionMethods;

public static class MyExtensions
{
    public static int WordCount(this string str) =>
        str.Split([' ', '.', '?'], StringSplitOptions.RemoveEmptyEntries).Length;
}
```

Both forms of extensions must be defined inside a non-nested, nongeneric static class.

And it can be called from an application by using the syntax for accessing instance members:

```csharp
string s = "Hello Extension Methods";
int i = s.WordCount();
```

While extension members add new capabilities to an existing type, extension members don't violate the principle of encapsulation. The access declarations for all members of the extended type apply to extension members.

Both the `MyExtensions` class and the `WordCount` method are `static`, and it can be accessed like all other `static` members. The `WordCount` method can be invoked like other `static` methods as follows:

```csharp
string s = "Hello Extension Methods";
int i = MyExtensions.WordCount(s);
```

The preceding C# code applies to both the extension block and `this` syntax for extension members. The preceding code:

- Declares and assigns a new `string` named `s` with a value of `"Hello Extension Methods"`.
- Calls `MyExtensions.WordCount` given argument `s`.

For more information, see [How to implement and call a custom  extension method](./how-to-implement-and-call-a-custom-extension-method.md).

In general, you probably call extension members far more often than you implement them. Because extension members are called as though they're declared as members of the extended class, no special knowledge is required to use them from client code. To enable extension members for a particular type, just add a `using` directive for the namespace in which the methods are defined. For example, to use the standard query operators, add this `using` directive to your code:

```csharp
using System.Linq;
```

## Binding extension members at compile time

You can use extension members to extend a class or interface, but not to override behavior defined in a class. An extension member with the same name and signature as an interface or class members are never called. At compile time, extension members always have lower priority than instance (or static) members defined in the type itself. In other words, if a type has a method named `Process(int i)`, and you have an extension method with the same signature, the compiler always binds to the member method. When the compiler encounters a member invocation, it first looks for a match in the type's members. If no match is found, it searches for any extension members that are defined for the type. It binds to the first extension member that it finds. The following example demonstrates the rules that the C# compiler follows in determining whether to bind to an instance member on the type, or to an extension member. The static class `Extensions` contains extension members defined for any type that implements `IMyInterface`:

```csharp
public interface IMyInterface
{
    void MethodB();
}

// Define extension methods for IMyInterface.

// The following extension methods can be accessed by instances of any
// class that implements IMyInterface.
public static class Extension
{
    public static void MethodA(this IMyInterface myInterface, int i) =>
        Console.WriteLine("Extension.MethodA(this IMyInterface myInterface, int i)");

    public static void MethodA(this IMyInterface myInterface, string s) =>
        Console.WriteLine("Extension.MethodA(this IMyInterface myInterface, string s)");

    // This method is never called in ExtensionMethodsDemo1, because each
    // of the three classes A, B, and C implements a method named MethodB
    // that has a matching signature.
    public static void MethodB(this IMyInterface myInterface) =>
        Console.WriteLine("Extension.MethodB(this IMyInterface myInterface)");
}
```

The equivalent extensions can be declared using the C# 14 extension member syntax:

```csharp
public static class Extension
{
    extension(IMyInterface myInterface)
    {
        public void MethodA(int i) =>
            Console.WriteLine("Extension.MethodA(this IMyInterface myInterface, int i)");

        public void MethodA(string s) =>
            Console.WriteLine("Extension.MethodA(this IMyInterface myInterface, string s)");

        // This method is never called in ExtensionMethodsDemo1, because each
        // of the three classes A, B, and C implements a method named MethodB
        // that has a matching signature.
        public void MethodB() =>
            Console.WriteLine("Extension.MethodB(this IMyInterface myInterface)");
    }
}
```

Classes `A`, `B`, and `C` all implement the interface:

```csharp
// Define three classes that implement IMyInterface, and then use them to test
// the extension methods.
class A : IMyInterface
{
    public void MethodB() { Console.WriteLine("A.MethodB()"); }
}

class B : IMyInterface
{
    public void MethodB() { Console.WriteLine("B.MethodB()"); }
    public void MethodA(int i) { Console.WriteLine("B.MethodA(int i)"); }
}

class C : IMyInterface
{
    public void MethodB() { Console.WriteLine("C.MethodB()"); }
    public void MethodA(object obj)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("C.MethodA(object obj)");
    }
}
```

The `MethodB` extension method is never called because its name and signature exactly match methods already implemented by the classes. When the compiler can't find an instance method with a matching signature, it binds to a matching extension method if one exists.

```csharp
// Declare an instance of class A, class B, and class C.
A a = new A();
B b = new B();
C c = new C();

// For a, b, and c, call the following methods:
//      -- MethodA with an int argument
//      -- MethodA with a string argument
//      -- MethodB with no argument.

// A contains no MethodA, so each call to MethodA resolves to
// the extension method that has a matching signature.
a.MethodA(1);           // Extension.MethodA(IMyInterface, int)
a.MethodA("hello");     // Extension.MethodA(IMyInterface, string)

// A has a method that matches the signature of the following call
// to MethodB.
a.MethodB();            // A.MethodB()

// B has methods that match the signatures of the following
// method calls.
b.MethodA(1);           // B.MethodA(int)
b.MethodB();            // B.MethodB()

// B has no matching method for the following call, but
// class Extension does.
b.MethodA("hello");     // Extension.MethodA(IMyInterface, string)

// C contains an instance method that matches each of the following
// method calls.
c.MethodA(1);           // C.MethodA(object)
c.MethodA("hello");     // C.MethodA(object)
c.MethodB();            // C.MethodB()
/* Output:
    Extension.MethodA(this IMyInterface myInterface, int i)
    Extension.MethodA(this IMyInterface myInterface, string s)
    A.MethodB()
    B.MethodA(int i)
    B.MethodB()
    Extension.MethodA(this IMyInterface myInterface, string s)
    C.MethodA(object obj)
    C.MethodA(object obj)
    C.MethodB()
 */
```

## Common usage patterns

### Collection Functionality

In the past, it was common to create "Collection Classes" that implemented the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1?displayProperty=nameWithType> interface for a given type and contained functionality that acted on collections of that type. While there's nothing wrong with creating this type of collection object, the same functionality can be achieved by using an extension on the <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1?displayProperty=nameWithType>. Extensions have the advantage of allowing the functionality to be called from any collection such as an <xref:System.Array?displayProperty=nameWithType> or <xref:System.Collections.Generic.List`1?displayProperty=nameWithType> that implements <xref:System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1?displayProperty=nameWithType> on that type. An example of this using an Array of Int32 can be found [earlier in this article](#orderby-example).

### Layer-Specific Functionality

When using an Onion Architecture or other layered application design, it's common to have a set of Domain Entities or Data Transfer Objects that can be used to communicate across application boundaries. These objects generally contain no functionality, or only minimal functionality that applies to all layers of the application. Extension methods can be used to add functionality that's specific to each application layer.

```csharp
public class DomainEntity
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public required string FirstName { get; set; }
    public required string LastName { get; set; }
}

static class DomainEntityExtensions
{
    static string FullName(this DomainEntity value)
        => $"{value.FirstName} {value.LastName}";
}
```

You can declare an equivalent `FullName` property in C# 14 and later using the new extension block syntax:

```csharp
static class DomainEntityExtensions
{
    extension(DomainEntity value)
    {
        string FullName => $"{value.FirstName} {value.LastName}";
    }
}
```

### Extending Predefined Types

Rather than creating new objects when reusable functionality needs to be created, you can often extend an existing type, such as a .NET or CLR type. As an example, if you don't use extension methods, you might create an `Engine` or `Query` class to do the work of executing a query on a SQL Server that might be called from multiple places in our code. However you can instead extend the <xref:System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection?displayProperty=nameWithType> class using extension methods to perform that query from anywhere you have a connection to a SQL Server. Other examples might be to add common functionality to the <xref:System.String?displayProperty=nameWithType> class, extend the data processing capabilities of the <xref:System.IO.Stream?displayProperty=nameWithType> object, and <xref:System.Exception?displayProperty=nameWithType> objects for specific error handling functionality. These types of use-cases are limited only by your imagination and good sense.

Extending predefined types can be difficult with `struct` types because they're passed by value to methods. That means any changes to the struct are made to a copy of the struct. Those changes aren't visible once the extension method exits. You can add the `ref` modifier to the first argument making it a `ref` extension method. The `ref` keyword can appear before or after the `this` keyword without any semantic differences. Adding the `ref` modifier indicates that the first argument is passed by reference. This technique enables you to write extension methods that change the state of the struct being extended (note that private members aren't accessible). Only value types or generic types constrained to struct (For more information about these rules, see the article on the [`struct` constraint](../../language-reference/builtin-types/struct.md#struct-constraint)) are allowed as the first parameter of a `ref` extension method or as the receiver of an extension block. The following example shows how to use a `ref` extension method to directly modify a built-in type without the need to reassign the result or pass it through a function with the `ref` keyword:

```csharp
public static class IntExtensions
{
    public static void Increment(this int number)
        => number++;

    // Take note of the extra ref keyword here
    public static void RefIncrement(this ref int number)
        => number++;
}
```

The equivalent extension blocks are shown in the following code:

```csharp
public static class IntExtensions
{
    extension(int number)
    {
        public void Increment()
            => number++;
    }

    // Take note of the extra ref keyword here
    extension(ref int number)
    {
        public void RefIncrement()
            => number++;
    }
}
```

Different extension blocks are required to distinguish by-value and by-ref parameter modes for the receiver.

You can see the difference applying `ref` to the receiver has in the following example:

```csharp
int x = 1;

// Takes x by value leading to the extension method
// Increment modifying its own copy, leaving x unchanged
x.Increment();
Console.WriteLine($"x is now {x}"); // x is now 1

// Takes x by reference leading to the extension method
// RefIncrement changing the value of x directly
x.RefIncrement();
Console.WriteLine($"x is now {x}"); // x is now 2
```

You can apply the same technique by adding `ref` extension members to user-defined struct types:

```csharp
public struct Account
{
    public uint id;
    public float balance;

    private int secret;
}

public static class AccountExtensions
{
    // ref keyword can also appear before the this keyword
    public static void Deposit(ref this Account account, float amount)
    {
        account.balance += amount;

        // The following line results in an error as an extension
        // method is not allowed to access private members
        // account.secret = 1; // CS0122
    }
}
```

The preceding sample can also be created using extension blocks in C# 14:

```csharp
public static class AccountExtensions
{
    extension(ref Account account)
    {
        // account is the receiver (analogous to the this parameter in extension methods).
        // The ref modifier on the extension block means the receiver is passed by reference.
        public void Deposit(float amount)
        {
            account.balance += amount;

            // The following line results in an error as an extension
            // method is not allowed to access private members
            // account.secret = 1; // CS0122
        }
    }
}
```

You can access these extension methods as follows:

```csharp
Account account = new()
{
    id = 1,
    balance = 100f
};

Console.WriteLine($"I have ${account.balance}"); // I have $100

account.Deposit(50f);
Console.WriteLine($"I have ${account.balance}"); // I have $150
```

## General Guidelines

It's preferable to add functionality by modifying an object's code or deriving a new type whenever it's reasonable and possible to do so. Extension methods are a crucial option for creating reusable functionality throughout the .NET ecosystem. Extension members are preferable when the original source isn't under your control, when a derived object is inappropriate or impossible, or when the functionality has limited scope.

For more information on derived types, see [Inheritance](../../fundamentals/object-oriented/inheritance.md).

If you do implement extension methods for a given type, remember the following points:

- An extension method isn't called if it has the same signature as a method defined in the type.
- Extension methods are brought into scope at the namespace level. For example, if you have multiple static classes that contain extension methods in a single namespace named `Extensions`, all of them are brought into scope by the `using Extensions;` directive.

For a class library that you implemented, you shouldn't use extension methods to avoid incrementing the version number of an assembly. If you want to add significant functionality to a library for which you own the source code, follow the .NET guidelines for assembly versioning. For more information, see [Assembly Versioning](../../../standard/assembly/versioning.md).
